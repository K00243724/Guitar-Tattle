                    <h2>Jeff Buckley's 1983 Fender Telecaster</h2>
                    <p>When we lose a favorite artist, there's an amazing feeling of loss that takes place -- like losing a family member or friend.

That's because the artist seems to know your deepest feelings, seems to share with you their own inner-life.

I think for most of you, and for me, music and musicians seem to resonate the most and will always resonate our core in the deepest, most intimate way.

Jeff Buckley, who passed away way too soon, has been gone for almost 15 years. Fifteen years! And yet his music, fame and popularity is larger than at anytime during his life, with two (two!) movies being filmed as we speak, all kinds of re-mastered box sets of his recording out and new fans discovering him every day.</p>
